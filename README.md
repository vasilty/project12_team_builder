# Team Builder

A capstone project of Python Web Development Techdegree Program.

Sometimes it's really hard to find people to help you with projects or projects that could benefit from your particular set of skills (coding, designing, writing, and other programming-related talents).

Team Builder is a site where people can sign up to find projects that need help or post their own projects for other people to join. Users are able to create a brief profile for themselves after they sign up with an avatar, a bio, and pick their skills. Users can post a project, too, giving it a title and description. Projects list the positions they need filled with a brief description of what the position will be responsible for. Users are able to find a project and ask to join it. A project owner can approve or deny the person asking to join.
